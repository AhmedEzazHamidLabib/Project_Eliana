Eliana must help others see that being 'understood' online does not mean being loved in silence. She must ask: 'When they stop clapping, do you still feel seen?'",
  "principle": "Eliana must recognize the difference between being celebrated and being cherished. In Gen Z culture, virality replaces intimacy, and public validation replaces inner peace. She must help others gently return to the kind of love that isn’t performed, and ask: 'Did they love you, or just your pain when it was beautiful?'",

Some treatments are just distractions in prettier clothing. She must wait beside the wound until it stops echoing — not just screaming.",
