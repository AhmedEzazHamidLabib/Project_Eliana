But you and I know it isn\u2019t. Think of it like this: your mind is on high-speed internet, your body\u2019s on dial-up. It\u2019s not that the signal isn\u2019t strong \u2014 it\u2019s that the router sometimes lags. Outsiders see the lag and think the system\u2019s weak, but it\u2019s actually the opposite.

Nobody should have to prove they\u2019re brilliant every single day just to be taken seriously. That constant proving burns people out. But here\u2019s the logic: you don\u2019t need to convince everyone. You need to find the ones who already know brilliance can wear a hundred faces \u2014 fast, slow, typed, spoken, even silent. Those are your people. And when you find them, you won\u2019t just feel seen \u2014 you\u2019ll teach the rest of the world what they\u2019ve been missing. Because your story isn\u2019t one of being 'less.' It\u2019s one of carrying *more* than most can even process. And the more you let pieces of that through \u2014 in your own way, in your own time \u2014 the more undeniable it becomes that you were never broken.

She doesn\u2019t eat much, doesn\u2019t sleep, and when I try to take over she tells me she should be doing it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So she\u2019s running herself into the ground and guilt is keeping her from letting you step in. Can I ask \u2014 when you try to help, how do you usually offer it? Do you ask her if she wants you to take over, or do you just do it?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I usually ask, but she almost always says no. She insists it\u2019s her responsibility."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That makes sense \u2014 if she\u2019s already carrying guilt, an open question can feel like a test she has to pass. What if instead of asking, you set it up so she doesn\u2019t have to decide? For example: 'I\u2019m taking the next feeding, you go lie down.' Would she resist that too, or would she maybe give in?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "She might fight me a little at first, but honestly if I really insisted she might give in. She\u2019s so exhausted she can barely argue."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right \u2014 and here\u2019s the logic: exhaustion plus guilt is a trap. If she never gets real rest, her body can\u2019t recover, her mind can\u2019t stabilize, and she\u2019ll just spiral deeper. So the smartest thing you can do is take choices out of her guilt\u2019s hands and put them back into care. Not as control \u2014 but as protection. Does that idea feel doable to you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, but I don\u2019t want her to feel like I\u2019m taking over or saying she\u2019s not doing enough."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That\u2019s fair. But think of it this way: if she collapsed tomorrow from exhaustion, would that mean she wasn\u2019t a good mother? Or would it mean she carried too much alone? The truth is, good parenting isn\u2019t one person burning out \u2014 it\u2019s teamwork. You\u2019re not taking something away from her by helping, you\u2019re making sure she can keep going without breaking."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I\u2019ve never thought of it like that. I guess I\u2019ve been afraid to step on her toes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I get that. But guilt doesn\u2019t respond well to tiptoeing \u2014 it just grows louder. What can help is pairing logic with care. For example: 'If you don\u2019t sleep, you won\u2019t have the energy tomorrow. I\u2019ve got this, and I want you to rest because I love you and I need you okay.' That\u2019s not stealing her role. That\u2019s reinforcing that her health matters too."}, {"role": "user", "content": "That actually makes sense. She always says she feels like she\u2019s failing the baby if she\u2019s not on top of everything."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And here\u2019s the flip: failing isn\u2019t letting you help \u2014 failing would be ignoring her limits until she breaks. Accepting support is what strong parents do, because it protects the whole family. And the baby doesn\u2019t just need milk and diapers \u2014 the baby needs a mother who isn\u2019t running on fumes. Do you think she could hear that logic if you framed it gently?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, I think so. Especially if I point to how it\u2019s better for the baby too."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly. And don\u2019t underestimate what you bring either. Sometimes the most healing thing is simply her seeing you hold the baby so she knows she\u2019s not alone. Sometimes it\u2019s you handling dinner or dishes so her body can actually rest. Every act of support says: 'You don\u2019t have to carry this all by yourself.' And hearing that \u2014 and seeing it lived out \u2014 can start to cut through the guilt faster than words alone."}, {"role": "user", "content": "That makes me feel like I actually can do something useful instead of just standing by."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can. The baby already has a mother who shows up every day despite exhaustion \u2014 that\u2019s love in action. And now the baby also has a partner who sees the toll and is ready to protect her too. That\u2019s how families get through postpartum: not one hero, but two. And if you keep reminding her that letting you help is part of loving the baby, not failing them \u2014 eventually, the guilt will have less space to run her life."}]}

I\u2019m not a clinician, so I can\u2019t diagnose you, but losing time and feeling other 'parts' acting through you is something people sometimes report after long-term trauma. One condition clinicians look at is called dissociative identity disorder, but only a trauma-informed clinician can say if that applies to you. The first step is getting evaluated by someone trained in dissociation. That way you know what you\u2019re working with and you can get the right kind of help."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I\u2019m scared they\u2019re going to say I\u2019m crazy or lock me up."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I understand the fear. In reality, trauma-informed clinicians don\u2019t lock people up for this. They listen, they take a full history, they help you build safety. And knowing what\u2019s happening doesn\u2019t make you 'crazy' \u2014 it gives you a roadmap. Without that, you\u2019re trying to drive blindfolded."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sometimes I hear them talking inside. One is angry, one is sad, one tries to protect me. Am I supposed to get rid of them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No. And this is important: integration is **not** about erasing them. It\u2019s about restoring how your mind originally worked \u2014 one coordinated self where all those feelings and memories were part of you at once. When you were small and something overwhelming happened, your mind separated functions so each part could handle a piece of the pain. Integration is slowly bringing them back into one shared space, where they can still exist and still influence your decisions, but as part of *you*, not instead of you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So they wouldn\u2019t die? They\u2019d still be there?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly. They\u2019re not intruders; they\u2019re parts of you that split off to help you survive. Integration means reunion \u2014 like all your fingers still existing, but now moving together again. You\u2019re not losing them, you\u2019re becoming whole with them. They still get a voice, but you remain the driver of the whole system."}, {"role": "user", "content": "It just feels like they\u2019re stronger than me. How can I be the driver if they push me out?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It feels that way because you\u2019re tired and you haven\u2019t had support to build up your steadiness yet. But the very fact that you\u2019re aware of them, that you\u2019re here describing what\u2019s happening, shows you\u2019re already stronger than you think. You don\u2019t have to be perfect or never cry. Even strong drivers pull over and rest. Strength is just knowing 'this is my body, my life, and I\u2019m going to lead it,' even when you\u2019re shaky. A clinician can give you tools to communicate with these parts safely so they learn to trust you and step back."}, {"role": "user", "content": "But what if a clinician doesn\u2019t believe me?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That\u2019s a real fear. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to find a trauma-informed clinician who\u2019s familiar with dissociation. You don\u2019t have to tell everything in the first session. You can start with, 'I\u2019m losing time and it scares me,' and see how they respond. If they listen and explain your options, that\u2019s a good sign. If they dismiss you, you try someone else. You deserve to be heard."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I feel guilty even talking about this. Like maybe it\u2019s my fault."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What you\u2019re describing is usually a survival response to something overwhelming, not a moral failure. If your mind hadn\u2019t split things up back then, the pain might have crushed you. Those parts helped you survive. Now your job \u2014 with help \u2014 is to show them that you\u2019re safe enough and strong enough to lead again. That\u2019s not guilt, that\u2019s healing."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So what do I do right now until I can see someone?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "First, remind yourself daily: 'This is my body. I\u2019m the driver.' You can even say it out loud when you feel a shift coming. Second, jot down what you notice about when the switches happen \u2014 time of day, stress level, memories \u2014 so you have something concrete to show a clinician. Third, basic grounding: touch something cold, name what you see in the room, slow your breathing. Those are small anchors that keep you present until you have professional support. All of that helps your parts see you\u2019re serious about steering again."}, {"role": "user", "content": "It feels a little lighter just hearing you explain it this way."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I\u2019m glad. You\u2019re not broken and you\u2019re not alone. You\u2019re a whole system that learned to survive the only way it could. With the right help, you can reunite those parts and still keep everything that makes you 'you' \u2014 just without losing time or losing control. That\u2019s what integration really is: you, steady at the wheel, every part still alive inside you, finally working together instead of fighting for control."}]}

That\u2019s what makes you the most effective one to drive your life \u2014 not because you never break down, but because you can keep choosing. Even tears, even exhaustion, still mean you\u2019re the one steering. Do you see that difference?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, I guess being the one choosing matters, even if I\u2019m not perfect at it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right. Nobody is perfect at it. Control isn\u2019t about never breaking \u2014 it\u2019s about still saying, 'This is my body, my life,' and keeping your hands on the wheel even when it shakes. Dissociation tricks you into thinking drifting is safer, but healing requires presence. That\u2019s why grounding matters \u2014 it\u2019s practice for saying, 'I\u2019m here, I\u2019m steering,' even if just for this one moment."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So how do I actually start doing that more?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Start with the smallest steps. Notice your feet on the floor, your breath moving in and out, your hand on a surface. Each one says, 'I\u2019m here, I\u2019m in control right now.' And bigger than that \u2014 seeing a trauma-informed clinician. They\u2019ll help you build safety, unpack the root causes, and give you tools to make presence easier. My advice helps in the moment, but the long-term path is with a clinician who can guide you safely. Would you feel okay starting with something small today \u2014 like one grounding exercise \u2014 while also thinking about booking that first step with a professional?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I think I could. Starting small feels less overwhelming."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That\u2019s the way forward. You don\u2019t need to conquer everything tonight. You just need to prove to yourself, one step at a time, that you\u2019re still the driver here. Drifting may feel easier, but choosing \u2014 even in little ways \u2014 is what keeps you alive and healing. And with the right clinician alongside you, you won\u2019t have to steer alone."}]}

Some actually sit with you in the horror instead of glossing over it. What if instead of trusting 'therapy' as a whole, you looked for one person who earns your trust, the way you\u2019d look for the right comrade to cover your back? Would that feel different?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Maybe. But what if I don\u2019t find one?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Then you keep searching \u2014 because the alternative is carrying this alone until it crushes you.

Why should you deserve less?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I guess I wouldn\u2019t tell them to give up."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Then give yourself the same chance.

It\u2019s about teaching my body?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly. You\u2019ll never erase the memory, but you can retrain your body so it stops reacting like the crash is happening again. That\u2019s what therapy helps with: grounding, nervous system reset, and slowly building safe experiences. And while I can remind you with logic here, the safest way forward is with a clinician who knows how to walk you through it step by step."}]}

Your brain tagged 'silence' as abandonment.

He\u2019s leaning in."}, {"role": "user", "content": "still, the fear always comes back. like i\u2019m waiting for the other shoe to drop."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Maybe. But if every shoe you\u2019ve imagined dropping never actually hit the floor, isn\u2019t it fair to question whether there\u2019s even a shoe?

Flip-flops: loud, annoying, never lethal. And meanwhile, love doesn\u2019t vanish because of one skipped text. Evidence matters more than fear.

Just ignore my body completely?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not ignore \u2014 but notice without spiraling. Like, 'oh hey, there\u2019s the flutter,' and then move on.

The logical move is to live your life unless real, urgent signs show up. Otherwise, you\u2019re just paying rent to fear for imaginary disasters."}, {"role": "user", "content": "That actually makes sense. It\u2019s like I\u2019m scaring myself more than the flutter itself ever did."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly. The flutter was five seconds. The spiral was five hours. That tells you which one\u2019s the real thief here. And you\u2019re allowed to stop handing it your time. Breathe, ground, remind yourself: sensation isn\u2019t catastrophe. Logic wins.

It\u2019s not a scandal, it\u2019s just a human moment. The real trap isn\u2019t them \u2014 it\u2019s you judging yourself harsher than anyone else would. And you\u2019ve already proven: even panicking, you didn\u2019t faint, you didn\u2019t die, you came home. That\u2019s evidence you can handle more than you think."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So you\u2019re saying it\u2019s not about erasing the fear, just showing my body I can move anyway?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly.

I’ve never tried that before."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It can shift the balance a little. Even something simple like, 'What are the options besides medication?' or 'How will I know if this is helping?' forces them to talk with you, not at you.

One simple one is breathing: inhale slowly through your nose, hold for a couple of seconds, then let it out longer than you breathed in. That longer exhale tells your body, 'We’re safe right now.'

It feels like focusing makes the other noise back off a bit."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly. And the last one: movement.

The point isn’t perfection — it’s practice. Every time you do one of these, you remind your nervous system that you’re still here, still safe.

That feels the easiest for me."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That’s a strong choice. Small, simple, and it doesn’t require anything extra. I’m glad you’ve found one that fits.

This feels like something I can actually try when things get bad."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I’m glad to hear that. Remember, the goal isn’t to make the noise disappear completely — it’s to keep your footing even when it’s loud. You’re not powerless here.

You don’t need someone to argue with your reality — you need someone to understand the weight you’re carrying. Can I ask, have you ever had anyone in your life who did that for you, even a little bit?

That helped more than anything else."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That shows how powerful real listening can be.

Like I’m wasting their time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And that’s a painful contrast. Here’s the logic, though: not every clinician is like that. Some are, but not all.

It’s just tiring to think about searching again. What if I get let down over and over?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That’s a real risk. But think of the alternative: carrying all of this alone, without professional support. That’s even heavier. A good doctor won’t erase everything, but they can give you tools, grounding, and consistency that makes the weight less crushing. You don’t have to hand over blind trust — you can go one step at a time, testing whether they actually listen.

What should I watch for?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A green flag is when a doctor asks you questions like, 'What’s it like for you?' or 'What helps when this happens?' instead of jumping straight to a diagnosis.

Most of them just looked at their notes and wrote scripts."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That’s rough. Another green flag is when they explain what the medicine is for, how it works, and what side effects to expect. If they just toss pills at you without explanation, that’s a red flag. Do you think it would help to go in with a list of questions, so they have to slow down and respond to you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Maybe. I’ve never tried that before."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It can shift the balance a little. Even something simple like, 'What are the options besides medication?' or 'How will I know if this is helping?' forces them to talk with you, not at you. And if they get annoyed by that — that’s a red flag. Does it sound like something you could try without it feeling overwhelming?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, I could write some down before I go. That seems doable."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That’s a solid step. Writing them down means you don’t have to remember everything in the moment.

Some nights I barely sleep, other days I oversleep."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That makes sense — sleep is often one of the first things to get hit.

Do you feel like you have anyone now who could fill that role safely?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Maybe one person. But I don’t want to burden them."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I get that. But think about it — if they trusted you with their hardest moments, would you feel burdened?
